This e-commerce site will be built using the MERN stack(MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). I am excited to use the MERN stack once again and fix the issues I had when I first learned this technology.

My main issues I originally had were the following:

1) I was unable to establish Auth for clients to view and use the site. 
2) CSS/SaSS was not visually pleasing and this will be addressed with this site. Might incorporate bootstrap/tailwind.css to make up for my CSS shortcomings.

Things I hope to add:

1) Admin access so that the shop owner can add/update/remove product from the site.
2) Shopping cart with payment system. I will try to incorporate the Stripe payment system.
